                Hi visitors, thank you for your time messing around with my
                project. I am Ee-Chee and proud of myself for completing this
                project in one week. I would like dedicate this to
                2-year-ago-of-me for making the right decision on changing my
                career path. At that time, I really struggled much and even
                suffered from depression. But now I know that every hardship I
                have been through is worth it. I will keep on moving and realize
                those dreams I have ever dreamed of. Life is an endless learning
                progress, it is not about how much income you make or how to
                impress others, it is about the happiness you acquired from your
                passion. Last but no least, a big thanks to my family,
                Spiced-Academy instructors and my fellow coursemates! Nice
                having you guys around : )
            </p>
