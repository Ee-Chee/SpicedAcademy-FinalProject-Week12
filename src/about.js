                Hi visitors, thank you for your time messing around with my
                project. I am Ee-Chee and proud of myself for completing this
                project in one week. I would like dedicate this project to
                2-year-ago-of-me and tell him, bro, you made the right decision
                on changing career path. It is always a tough time to make
                significant changes in our life. Back at that time, I really
                struggled much and felt super depressed. But NOW I know that it
                is worth for every hardship I had been through. I found my
                passion! Life is an endless learning progress, it is not about
                how much income you make or how do you impress others, it is
                about the happiness you acquire from your passion. Last but no
                least, a big thanks to my <strong>Leng&apos;s</strong> family,
                Spiced-Academy instructors and my fellow coursemates! Nice
                having you guys around : )
            </p>
